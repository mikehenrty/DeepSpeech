# In particular, one must introduce a means to isolate the inference and gradient
# calculations on the various GPU's.
# The abstraction we intoduce for this purpose is called a 'tower'.
# A tower is specified by two properties:
# * **Scope** - A scope, as provided by `tf.name_scope()`,
# is a means to isolate the operations within a tower.
# For example, all operations within "tower 0" could have their name prefixed with `tower_0/`.
# * **Device** - A hardware device, as provided by `tf.device()`,
# on which all operations within the tower execute.
# For example, all operations of "tower 0" could execute on the first GPU `tf.device('/gpu:0')`.

# As we are introducing one tower for each GPU, first we must determine how many GPU's are available
# Get a list of the available gpu's ['/gpu:0', '/gpu:1'...]

    ``(graph, data_set, tower_results, saver, apply_gradient_op, merged, writer)``.
    The first four items are the same as in the above case.
    ``apply_gradient_op`` is an operator that applies the gradents to the learned parameters.
